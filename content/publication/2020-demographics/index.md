abstract: "We incorporate low-frequency information from demographic variables into a simple predictive
model to forecast stock valuations and returns using demographic projections. The demographics
appear to be an important determinant of stock valuations, such as the dividend-price ratio.
The availability of long-term demographic projections allows us to provide (very) long-horizon
forecasts of stock market valuations and returns. We also exploit the strong contemporaneous
correlation between returns and valuations to improve return forecasts â€“ something which is not
possible in a predictive regression with only lagged predictors. Extensive pseudo out-of-sample
forecast comparisons and tests demonstrate the predictive value that an accurate demographic
projection can deliver. Although the availability of historical Census Bureau projections are
limited, we demonstrate that they could have been employed in real time to improve true longhorizon
stock return prediction. The model also provides a simple way to adjust predictions
under alternative demographic assumptions, incorporating, for example, the demographic impact
of COVID-19 or recent changes to immigration policy."
