publication_short: "Nonlinearities play an increasingly important role in applied work when studying
the responses of macroeconomic aggregates to policy shocks. Seemingly natural adaptations
of the popular local linear projection estimator to nonlinear settings may fail to
recover the population responses of interest. In this paper we study the properties of
an alternative nonparametric local projection estimator of the conditional and unconditional
responses of an outcome variable to an observed identified shock. We discuss
alternative ways of implementing this estimator and how to allow for data-dependent
tuning parameters. Our results are based on data generating processes that involve,
respectively, nonlinearly transformed regressors, state-dependent coefficients, and nonlinear
interactions between shocks and state variables. Monte Carlo simulations show
that a local-linear specification of the estimator tends to work well in reasonably large
samples and is robust to nonlinearities of unknown form."
