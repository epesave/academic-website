abstract: "The ease of estimating linear local projections has made them a popular tool for
impulse response function analysis. Koles´ar and Plagborg-Møller’s main goal is to
inquire whether local projections (LP) estimands of impulse response functions have
a causal interpretation when the data generating process (DGP) is nonlinear. This
discussion focuses on two questions. First, how should we interpret the magnitude of
the linear LP estimands in nonlinear environments? Second, is the linear LP useful
when the researcher is interested in the effects of large shocks rather than small
shocks?"
