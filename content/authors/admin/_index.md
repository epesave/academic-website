Elena Pesavento is an Associate Professor in the Department of Economics at Emory University. Her specialty is Time Series Analysis with focus on inference and testing in Vector Autoregressive Models. In particular, she studies inference when variables are non-stationary (in the presence of unit roots, cointegration or structural breaks) or persistent (local to unity). Her more recent recent focuses on the analysis of non-linear models with particular interest in identification and estimatation of impulse response functions in non-linear VARs.  Her BS is Statistics started her passion for making statistics fun to undergraduate and graduate students that she now continues to pursue in her teaching. She is also committed to faculty governance at Emory, having served in leadership roles within the Emory College. In her spare time, she competes in agility with her dogs.
